Question 1: â€œHow is this LWP library different from a real
thread management library? Name two ways in which this LWP library API could
be improved."

Answer 1: LWP doesn't support hyper threading, as the kernel is unaware of the
existence of LWPs and thus cannot put separate threads on multiple cores.

Our LWP also has no protection against resource sharing synchronization issues,
so if one thread were to access a shared resources, yield, and use that resource
after another thread has modified it, an error could occur. 

Similarly, our LWP could become deadlocked should two threads wait for eachogther's
execution.
